The text reads \"TRUMP: He is come to clean America,\" suggesting a tough, action-hero persona. The \"COMING SOON 2016\" refers to the year Donald Trump ran for and won the U.S. presidential election.\\n\\n**Exaggeration**: Similar to Hyperbole. Use of exaggerated terms for emphasis, including exaggerated visuals (including unrealistic features portraying minorities).\\n \\nExample of exaggeration:\\nThe meme humorously portrays Madagascar\\'s extreme response with exaggerated urgency.
