Use of exaggerated terms for emphasis, including exaggerated visuals (including unrealistic features portraying minorities).\\n \\n**Irony**: Similar to Sarcasm. Use of words that convey a meaning that is the opposite of its usual meaning/mock someone or something with caustic or bitter use of words.\\n  \\n**Anthropomorphism**: Similar to Zoomorphism. Attributing human qualities to animals, objects, natural phenomena or abstract concepts or applying animal characteristics to humans in a way that conveys additional meaning. \\n \\n**Metaphor**: Similar to Simile. Implicit or explicit comparisons between two items or groups, attributing the properties of one thing to another.
